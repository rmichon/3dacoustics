# 3D Acoustics

## Overview

Advanced 3D printing techniques allow for the making of complex musical 
instrument parts such as resonators (e.g., string instrument bodies, etc.) or 
sound generators (e.g., membranes, etc.). They also enable for the precise 
control of the various parameters of the final product (e.g., uniformity of 
material properties, size, shape, etc.). Beside being a potential revolution 
for lutherie in general, it is also a fantastic opportunity to test physical 
modeling algorithms (e.g., FDTD schemes, etc.) under certain conditions. 
Being able to predict the sound of an instrument before printing it would be an 
invaluable tool for luthiers using this type of technology.

The main goal of this project is to ally the expertise on physical modeling of 
musical instruments of researchers at CCRMA (Stanford University) and NTNU 
(Trondheim, Norway) to  HP Incâ€™s Multi-Jet Fusion Technology provided by HP 
Labs (Palo Alto, USA).
